#Lab Report 5, CSE 15L

Student post asking for help with getting rid of bug in code:

Hello, 

I am having issues implementing the function Add. This method is supposed to take the String elements in an array (which all contain numeric text),
and add the numbers in the array together,and then return the result. However, there is a compile error. The error message says that I cannot convert 
an int into a string. But this does not make sense because I am trying to convert a string into a double, not an int type into a string. My best 
guess is either that Double.parseInt is the wrong method to use here, or that I am doing the conditions for the for-loop wrong. What do you think?

(I have attached screenshots of the symptom and code below.
